As a busy parent (and fellow tabletop enthusiast!), I completely understand the feeling of staring at a blank page, desperately trying to conjure up a compelling adventure for your players. The pressure to deliver amazing stories can be overwhelming.

## Introducing GimmeAHook

GimmeAHook is a FoundryVTT module designed to kickstart your creativity. It uses IntegrateAI to generate unique plot hooks based on your input – genre, length, theme, and even things you want to *exclude* from the generated hook.

### How it Works

- **Simple Input:** Just specify the basics (e.g., “fantasy adventure, short, no dragons”).
- **AI-Powered Generation:** The module uses IntegrateAI to create a fresh plot hook.
- **Customize:** Add a description or exclude specific elements to tailor the hook to your vision.

**It’s not about replacing your creativity – it's about sparking it.** Sometimes, all you need is a little nudge to get the ideas flowing.

Let GimmeAHook be your secret weapon against writer’s block. Happy gaming!
